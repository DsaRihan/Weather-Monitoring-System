# Weather-Monitoring-System
The Weather Monitoring System is a web application designed to provide real-time weather updates for the user's current location. Built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this system offers a user-friendly interface to display key weather parameters such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, and cloud coverage.

Features:

*Location Access:

The application prompts the user to allow access to their current location through the browser's geolocation API.
Once the user grants permission, the application retrieves the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).

*Weather Data Retrieval:

The application uses the retrieved coordinates to fetch weather data from a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).
It makes an asynchronous request to the API and processes the response to extract relevant weather information.

*Weather Information Display:

The weather data is dynamically displayed on the web page using JavaScript.
The interface shows the current temperature, wind speed, humidity, and cloud coverage in a clear and organized manner.
Additional weather details such as weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy) can also be displayed using appropriate icons and descriptions.

*Responsive Design:

The application is designed with a responsive layout to ensure it looks good on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
CSS is used to style the elements and ensure a visually appealing user interface.
